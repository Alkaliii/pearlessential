<h2>Status</h2>

pearlessential is currently in development. The available test build usually differs from the bleeding edge version on my machine. 
Some bugs may already be fixed and awaiting the chance to be pushed in a new patch. Please understand I am a single person working
on this in my spare time. I have no formal CS experience and I'm learning new things every day. Please don't assume a bug or issue
is being ignored, I'll try my best to label every issue with my intentions in regard to them.

Once again, thank you for playtesting!
